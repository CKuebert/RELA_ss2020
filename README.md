R scripts for the remote sensing course "Dynamik der Landoberfläche" within the summer term 2020
The course focusses on land surface dynamics using EO data and the course is split into two parts. 

Part 1 focusses on the theoretical background of time series in general and MODIS data provided by the LP DAAC. Hands on data training is carried out using the products MOD13Q1 (MODIS VI 250m 16-days) and MOD13A3 (MODIS VI 1km monthly). In order to adapt to the COVID-19 situation, all students received free ENVI licences from Harris and additionally, advanced students can strengthen their knowledge in R with the code provided here. We are adressing vegetation dynamics forLower Franconia between 2001 and 2019. The small study area was choosen with respect to possible hard- and software restrictions, since the students need to use their own laptops and can't access the CIP-pools this term. 

The provided code structures and analysis MODIS data downloaded using The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AρρEEARS)[https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/appeears/]

Part 2 of the course will focus on bigger study areas using Google Earth Engine (GEE)[https://earthengine.google.com/]. This will allow the students to perform data intensive analysis of the land surface dynamic on a free topic - without hard- and software restrictions.

R scripts for the remote sensing course <a href="https://wuestudy.zv.uni-wuerzburg.de:443/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=112146&periodId=288&navigationPosition=studiesOffered,courseoverviewShow">Dynamik der Landoberfläche</a> within the summer term 2020

The course focusses on land surface dynamics using EO data and the course is split into two parts. 

Part 1 focusses on the theoretical background of time series in general and MODIS data provided by the LP DAAC. Hands on data training is carried out using the products <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v006/">MOD13Q1</a> (MODIS VI 250m 16-days) and <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13a3v006/">MOD13A3</a> (MODIS VI 1km monthly). 
In order to adapt to the COVID-19 situation, all students received free <a href="https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/ENVIENVI">ENVI</a> licences and additionally, advanced students can strengthen their knowledge in R with the code provided here. We are adressing vegetation dynamics forLower Franconia between 2001 and 2019. The small study area was choosen with respect to possible hard- and software restrictions, since the students need to use their own laptops and can't access the CIP-pools this term. 

The provided code structures and analysis MODIS data downloaded using The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (<a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/appeears/">AρρEEARS</a>)

Part 2 of the course will focus on bigger study areas using Google Earth Engine (<a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">GEE</a>). This will allow the students to perform data intensive analysis of the land surface dynamic on a free topic - without hard- and software restrictions.
